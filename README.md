# Shamava-Stream-Your-Videos
A simple node app that helps stream your favorite videos by letting you upload your files onto the server. this code is for educational purposes and is not recommended to be used
in production. Sorry for the ugly interface(Im more of a backend guy but generally fullstack). I use it to stream videos to our TV for my family and works pretty well. Hope you enjoy
